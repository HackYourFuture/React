# Homework

### Start the homework

Need to brush up on the homework setup process? Check [this](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/Git/blob/main/homework_hand_in.md) out before you get into some git confusion!

This week the homework will result in 2 PRs: 1 in your homework repository and 1 in the Meal Sharing repository.


## Github users search

your homework will be searching github users based on the what you type in the input. Use this api: `https://api.github.com/search/users?q=${query}`

Requirements:

- When the search is loading, you should show "loading..."
- When the search is failed, you should show "error fetching (reason why it failed)..."
- When the search result is empty (no users), you should show "No results..."
- All state should be managed using the context api!

## Meal Sharing

Let's not forget to give some attention to the Meal Sharing frontend! 
You have built a ``MealList`` last week. 
Now build the ``Meal`` component so that you can use it in the MealsList and render a nice Meal card for each meal. Decide how the Meal card should look like and style it. 
The component should accept a meal object as a prop and render all its relevant details. The MealsList should render all the meals in a grid.
