Don't you love it when a company provides great customer service?

Take a look at the following image:

![Exercise 2](../../assets/exercises/exercise2.png)

In this exercise you have to create a single component that you'll reuse to display different information each time.

1. Run `npm create vite` in this folder to create your environment
2. Create a functional component called `<Guarantee>`
3. Instantiate it 3 times
4. Give each component 3 `props`: an `img`, `title` and `description`
5. Pass down to each component the appropriate content. Take the images from the **assets** folder, inside the **exercises** folder
6. Test out if it works by importing it into the top level component, which is `<App>`
