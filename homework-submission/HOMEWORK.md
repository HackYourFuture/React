# Homework Submission

All homework should be within this directory, and this directory only. Please place your homework in a directory anywhere at `/homework-submission/*`, eg: `/homework-submission/my-project/package.json`.

Homework is then submitted via PR in the normal way.

Homework will not be reviewed unless:

1. Your PR _only_ modifies the `homework-submission` directory
2. Your PR passes linting
