There are two folders for this homework:

1 - my-app: This is a Dynamic Todo lists application where all the react components are separated in different files. All this was done thanks to create-react-app method.

2 - static_list: This is a static Todo list application where all the react components are written in just one js file, this app takes 3 files. HTML - CSS - JS(with JSX code). Open the HTML with live server.

Enjoy the review and thank you in advance.
