##This homework aims to show that we can also run our project directly from back-end by node.js using express.

##You can run the project by one of the commands below

first make sure installing dependencies by `npm install`

1 - `npm run server` (runs the project manually from server using express, project will run on http://localhost:5000/)
2 - `npm run client` (runs the project automatically using react, project will run on http://localhost:3000/)
3 - `npm run dev` (runs the project both using react and server, project will run both on http://localhost:5000/ and http://localhost:3000/)
