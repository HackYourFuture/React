# React Test
At the end of the module you’ll be doing a React test. It will be about all the main React concepts you’ve learned these past 4 weeks. 

## Practical information
-  The test will start at 12.00 until 14.00 . The door will open at 11.45.
-  You’ll build a small React application (frontend only). It’ll involve an external API and some CSS styling.

## Purpose of the test
The purpose of this exam is to test your comprehension of React.
- Are you able to reproduce the concepts accurately?
- Are you able to combine the concepts in order to build a functional Single Page Application?

## Test material
The test will be about all the main React concepts you’ve learned about these past 4 weeks. The following are the most important that will be tested:
- `State`
- `Props`
- `Lifecycle methods`
- `Components (functional components)`
- `Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)`
- `API calls`
- `Context API`

## Preparation
For each of these concepts you must be able to:
Write the basic code structure of it,
know when to apply them, and
apply it cleanly/coherently with the rest of your code.
How to do so:
Practice with each concept in isolation first, write out the basic structure multiple times until you’ve memorized it.
 Then study some use cases (in other words, real-life situations that involve that concept)  and try to notice the patterns that emerge.
Finally build some small projects yourself to get used to writing React applications. 
Practice making a simple todo list application.

## During the test
Advise on how to make a test:
- Look for low hanging fruit. What part is easiest for you to do? Tackle that one first. 
- When writing your code, write small chunks at a time, testing each time before continuing. Use temporary console.log statements to show intermediate results (remove when no longer needed). Don't continue until the code written sofar is working correctly. If you write a whole bunch of code without intermediate testing it becomes difficult to pinpoint where issues occur.
- If you get stuck in an assignment, move on to the next one. You can always come back later if time permits.
- When writing code for the browser, always open the Chrome Developer Tools. Watch out for error messages in the browser console. Inspect the network tab to examine the data returned from a remote API.
- **Don't over-deliver.** If styling is not required by the assignment, skip it. If time permits, you can do it later. The same goes for handling fetch errors. Focus on delivering a minimum working version that meets the requirement. Ticking off a working version again reduces your stress level. Come back later, if time permits, to embellish your solutions.
- Don't use Google as a replacement for common sense.
- After finishing an assignment, read the question again to make sure you actually gave an answer to the question. 
- **Before handing in the test, read it all over again to pick out the small mistakes.**
