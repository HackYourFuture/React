# Homework

## Get git ready to work on homework

Using the `hyf-homework` repo. In the terminal run `git status`

If there are changes that have not been committed, figure out what to do with those changes
- Should they be committed to another branch?
- Should they be committed to `master`?
- Should they be discarded?

When you have figured out what to do with the changes and fixed those. Write `git status` again. If it says `nothing to commit, working tree clean`. Then you are ready to create the branch for this weeks homework.

### Creating the branch
Using the `hyf-homework` repo write this command

`git checkout master` - You are now on the `master` branch

`git checkout -b react/week5`

This will create and checkout the branch so you are ready make commits to it

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYlgh9hSWtw) can help. On slack use the #git-support channel to ask questions about git

## Github search

- The github search becomes the home page of your project.
- When you list the github users you can click on individual users to navigate to the profile
- In the profile component you need to fetch details about the github user and display them in a nice way using css, you can get inspiration from [a github profile](https://github.com/younesmln)
- Create an about page and fill it with some relevant info about the project (used technologies as an example maybe).

## Hand in Homework:

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feyBVDhFQuk) for a more detailed go-through of how to hand in homework!

- Use the branch called `react/week5` 
- Add all your changes to this branch in the `react/week5` folder. 
- Go through the [Homework checklist](#homework-checklist)
- Create a pull request using the `react/week5` branch
- Wait for mentor feedback
- Implement feedback, `add`, `commit` and `push` the changes
- Now you can merge the changes into `master`
- When merged you can **share the github link** to your classes slack channel if you are **proud of what you did** 💪
- Now celebrate 🎉🎉🎉

## Homework checklist
Go over your homework one last time:

- [ ] Does every file run without errors and with the correct results?
- [ ] Have you used `const` and `let` and avoided `var`?
- [ ] Do the variable, function and argument names you created follow the [Naming Conventions](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md)?
- [ ] Is your code well-formatted (see [Code Formatting](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md))?

## Feedback giving time!
Find a student to give feedback using this site: https://hyf-peer-review.herokuapp.com/. The feedback should be given after the homework has been handed in, preferably two days after. 

Give the review on the PR exactly how the mentors do it! To find the link for the PR ask the person you are reviewing :) You can see how to give feedback on a PR using github [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request)

To help you get started with reviewing we have created [some ressources](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/curriculum/tree/master/review) about giving feedback. Find them 

Why is it important to give feedback? Because it will make you a [better](https://www.brightspot.com/blog/developer-life-5-reasons-why-the-code-review-process-is-critical-for-developers) [developer](https://www.sitepoint.com/the-importance-of-code-reviews/)
