# Homework React Week 3

## **Todo list**

1. Practice the concepts
2. React exercises
3. Code along
4. PROJECT: Hack Your Weather III

## **1. Practice the concepts**

This week we'll practice some (hopefully) familiar concepts, with some online exercises. Do the exercises from `Introduction to the React Challenges` until `Access Props Using this.props`:

- [FreeCodeCamp: exercise 1-20](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/react/)

## **2. React exercises**

> Inside of your `React` fork, go to the `week3` folder and create a folder called `react-exercises`. For each exercise create a new folder (call it `exercise` follwed by the right number) and create 3 files: and `index.html`, `script.js` and `style.css`.

**Exercise 1**

**Exercise 2**

**Exercise 3**

## **3. Code along**

In the following tutorial you'll learn how to make

## **4. PROJECT: Hack Your Weather III**

> Every week ends with a project you have to build on your own. Instead of getting clear-cut instructions, you'll get a list of criteria that your project needs to measure up to.

> Before you start, create a new folder called `project` that includes the files for the following app you'll be building.

## **SUBMIT YOUR HOMEWORK!**

After you've finished your list it's time to show us what you got! Upload all your files to a forked repository (a copy from the original, which in this case is the [React](https://www.github.com/HackYourFuture/React) repository) using GIT. Then make a pull request to your teacher's forked repository.

If you need a refresher, take a look at the following [guide](../hand-in-homework-guide.md) to see how it's done.

The homework that needs to be submitted is the following:

1. React exercises
2. Project: Hack Your Weather III
