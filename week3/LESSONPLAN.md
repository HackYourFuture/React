# Lesson Plan Week 3

## Agenda

The purpose of this class is to teach the student about:

- What `component lifecycle` is
- The purpose and use of `useEffect()`
- Making an `API call` both inside and outside `useEffect()`
- Some third party React tools (`UI toolkits` and `utility libraries`)

## Core Concepts

1. Component lifecycle

- In React any component renders in stages to the DOM: we call this the `component lifecycle`
- The purpose of the different lifecycle stages is to **solve rendering issues** that sometimes can't easily be controlled via state and props
- 4 groups of lifecycle methods: **mounting**, **updating**, **unmounting** and **errors**

_Show the following [image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*cEWErpe-oY-_S1dOaT1NtA.jpeg) to illustrate the place and purpose of each lifecycle method. Then show how to access the methods in a class-based component_

3. Third party React tools

- 2 broad categories: `UI toolkits` and `utility libraries`
- `UI toolkits` help us structure our user interfaces

_Show example of a UI toolkit, like Semantic UI. You can illustrate how to use it by building a [Menu](https://react.semantic-ui.com/collections/menu/)_

- `Utility libraries` help us solve functional problems that come up during development

_Show example of a utility library, for example [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)_
