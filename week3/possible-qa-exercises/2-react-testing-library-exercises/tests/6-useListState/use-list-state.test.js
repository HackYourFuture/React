/**
 * useListState is a custom hook, which means we (just like with a context) have
 * something that does not render anything to the screen. We can use the same
 * trick as with contexts and write our own test component that puts it all on
 * the screen, but there is a built-in way especially for custom hooks.
 *
 * Have a look at https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-test-custom-react-hooks
 * where you can find how the `renderHook` function can help

/**
 * For the hook we have a couple of things to check:
 * - We provide an initialList, we should check that that one is actually filled
 * in
 * - We get an addElement function, we should use that and see that the list is
 * updated
 * - We get a removeElementById function, we should use that and see that the
 * list is updated
