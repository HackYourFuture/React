/**
 * Routing is a very simple routing component that looks to route a couple of
 * pages for the user.
 * Implementing routing is actually quite simple, but routing can be a little
 * more tricky if you don't know the tricks.
 * Have a look at the react-router-dom documentation and see how you can
 * implement the tests. For routing you want to test:
 *
 * - Check every route that it goes to the right component. Remember that you
 * don't need to test anything in the component you routed to! That is for that
 * component's tests to handle.
 * - Check that a route that has a parameter (:id usually) correctly grabs that
 * parameter.
 *
 * You may be wondering how it works with buttons on pages that redirect to
 * other pages (a list component going to a details component for example). That
 * is also the responsibility of the tests in that component.
