/**
 * UserDetailsForm is a component that has some user interaction so is a little
 * more complex.
 *
 * A nice way of thinking about what to test is to look at the steps the user
 * can take when they interact with this component. So:
 * - Read the current information (check that this is correct based on the prop)
 * - Change a field (check that the changes are applied in the UI)
 * - Click on the Submit button (check that the fields are sent to the function)
