/**
 * MyProfile in essence is very similar to a simple component that reacts
 * (haha, get it?) based on props it is given.
 * The only difference is that the props are given by a context rather than
 * directly to the component.
 *
 * It would be tempting to wrap your component in the
 * LoggedInUserContextProvider, but you will notice that you then do not have a
 * lot of control over what is being provided to your component.
 * This lack of control will make it more difficult to specifically test the
 * component. Besides, we should not be testing the workings of the Provider
 * here, we need to test MyProfile. So we can use the same trick as we use in
 * testing the Context, a specific component just for this test that will create
 * a provider in the state we want it!
