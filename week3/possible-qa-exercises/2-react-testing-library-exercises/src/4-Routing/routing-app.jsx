/**
 * You will notice that we need to separate our BrowserRouter from the actual
 * Routing component. The reason is that to test the routing we will need to use
 * a different component. The BrowserRouter as the name suggests works in a
 * browser, whereas our tests do not run in a browser.
 *
 * You will not be able to test the RoutingApp component in jest, for that we
 * will trust in the e2e tests (in cypress for example). It is good to be aware
 * of that though and keep a wrapper component like this as small as possible!
