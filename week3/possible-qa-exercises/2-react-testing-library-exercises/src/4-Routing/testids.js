/**
 * As we are now testing more complex components and are getting ready to do
 * testing in bigger projects it is time to start splitting up code again.
 * In previous tests you have written you have probably used the text or type of
 * element to find it on the screen. That is definitely an option if your test
 * provides the text or element, but can cause some problems later on when other
 * features are added (multiple languages for example!).
 *
 * A common solution to this is to use the `data-testid` attribute on elements.
 * These will never need to be changed for app purposes and such provide a great
 * way to consistently identify the parts of your app you want to check.
 *
 * The reason for putting them all in a separate file is to lower the risk that
 * there are no duplicate strings used. (It would probably be a good idea to
 * write a test that makes sure that no duplicate strings are exported here ;)).
 * Duplicate strings can cause the strangest test fails or even worse, can cause
 * tests to pass without testing what you are actually testing. If every page
 * had a div with a data-testid of `container` for example, and you want to
 * check that the page went to the Home page by checking that the data-testid
 * is `container`. Then you would get a false positive if you would send it to
 * the UserList component. The test would be green but the app would be broken.
