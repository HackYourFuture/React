## Read up before we get started

Watch this video from Facebook about why they started React:

https://youtu.be/nYkdrAPrdcw

Also be sure you're familiar with ES6-syntax. See this video about ES6 (the video is in Node, but the syntax for React is the same):

https://www.lynda.com/Node-js-tutorials/Switching-ES6-Node-js/546100-2.html

This is a handy reference of all features of ES6:

http://es6-features.org

Please *do not worry about understanding all*. However, do make sure you understand the following, as we'll be using them a lot:

- http://es6-features.org/#Constants
- http://es6-features.org/#ObjectMatchingShorthandNotation
- http://es6-features.org/#RestParameter
- http://es6-features.org/#SpreadOperator

## Real world example

Have a look at Exemplary real world application built with React + Redux:

# Beyond React

The following libraries are worth mentioning to use in conjunction with React:

- **[FlowType](https://flowtype.org)** - a way to annotate ES6 with types, similar to TypeScript
- **[Redux](https://flowtype.org)** - predictable (application) state container, a Flux implementation
- **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org)** - a JS packager, used by `create-react-app`
- **[Babel](https://babeljs.io)** - a ES6+ to JS transpiler, also used by `create-react-app`
- **[JSS](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss)** - a way to write CSS-like styles inside your component files
