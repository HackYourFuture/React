# Homework Week 1

usign `create-react-app` create a new react project.

## Outline

Render a basic static todo list with three items:

```
Todo List

* Get out of bed, Wed Sep 13 2017
* Brush teeth, Thu Sep 14 2017
* Eat breakfast, Fri Sep 15 2017
```

For each item render a description and a deadline date. Before you start draw a mockup and identify the components with colours. You have to use more than two components. Think which props the components should take.
