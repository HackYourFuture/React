# Homework Week 1

Fork this repository and use `create-react-app` to create your project inside the `homework-submission` directory.

When you are done issue a PR with your homework as explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0yomUVVpU&index=2&list=PLVYDhqbgYpYUGxRdtQdYVE5Q8h3bt6SIA) made by Daan.

## Outline

Render a basic static todo list with three items:

```
Todo List

* Get out of bed, Wed Sep 13 2017
* Brush teeth, Thu Sep 14 2017
* Eat breakfast, Fri Sep 15 2017
```

For each item render a description and a deadline date. Before you start draw a mockup and identify the components with colours. You have to use more than two components. Think which props the components should take.

## Scoring

You will be scored on:

- Correct functionality
- Code organisation
- Cleanliness of code
