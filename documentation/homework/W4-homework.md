# Homework Week 4

Base your week 4 homework on what was thought in tne week 4 class .

When you are done, create a new PR for week 4.

## Outline

Extend the project done in class so that:

- You show the name and location of the searched github user. (Hint: you need to use this endpoint : https://api.github.com/users)
- Manipulate the response body object so that your React app can display the name and location of the github user searched.


Continue using the github API through this url - https://api.github.com/ - (Hint: use postman to query the github API)

- By querying the above url you will view all the api urls that the github API has. You can try to explore them, we recommend that you read the github API documentation. (https://developer.github.com/v3/#current-version)
    - You can try to retrieve the repos data from the HackYourFuture-CPH organisation - (Hint: https://api.github.com/users/.../repos)
    - You can try to display the name of all the repos in your React app
    - If this is to easy for you... surprise us with your creativity... build up on your project and we will have a look!! ;)
