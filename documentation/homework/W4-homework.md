Base your week 4 homework on the result of week 3. We are going to implement client-side routing in our application, using [React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start).

## Learning goals

By doing this homework you will learn:

- How the `concept of routing` is applied to a SPA

## Outline

1. Refactor the Express server to hand client-side routing over to React-Router

**NOT FINISHED**

2. Incorporate React-Router into your application.

- Make a separate frontend route for each week of your homework
- `/week1` should display your Static Todolist
- `/week2` should display your improved Dynamic Todolist
- `/week3` should display your components that present the data from the API call above
- Put links to each route in the component that's displayed in the `/` route

## Extra material to practice

- Play around with the code from [Modal Gallery](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/modal-gallery)

## Scoring

You will be scored on:

- Correct functionality
- Code organisation
- Cleanliness of code

## Submit homework

When you are done issue a PR with your homework as explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0yomUVVpU&index=2&list=PLVYDhqbgYpYUGxRdtQdYVE5Q8h3bt6SIA) made by Daan.
