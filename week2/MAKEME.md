# Homework React Week 2

## **Todo list**

## **1. Practice the concepts**

We'll start the week off with some online exercises again. Complete the exercises from the following:

- [Codecademy: Learn ReactJS II](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-102)

## **2. React exercises**

> Inside of your `React` fork, go to the `week2` folder and create a folder called `react-exercises`. For each exercise create a new folder (call it `exercise` follwed by the right number) and create 3 files: and `index.html`, `script.js` and `style.css`.

**Exercise 1**

**Exercise 2**

**Exercise 3**

## **3. Code along**

In the following tutorial you'll learn how to make

- [Build a Recipe App With React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9T6YkEDkMo)
- [Build a Calculator with React and Flexbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzYUuTiHdiY)

- [Build a Random Quote Machine](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3cz80ehFCan4srLIp1HmhrQ0CU8Cw9XM)

## **4. PROJECT: Hack Your Todolist II**

> Every week ends with a project you have to build on your own. Instead of getting clear-cut instructions, you'll get a list of criteria that your project needs to measure up to.

> Before you start, create a new folder called `project` that includes the files for the following app you'll be building.

## **SUBMIT YOUR HOMEWORK!**

After you've finished your list it's time to show us what you got! Upload all your files to a forked repository (a copy from the original, which in this case is the [React](https://www.github.com/HackYourFuture/React) repository) using GIT. Then make a pull request to your teacher's forked repository.

If you need a refresher, take a look at the following [guide](../hand-in-homework-guide.md) to see how it's done.

The homework that needs to be submitted is the following:

1. React exercises
