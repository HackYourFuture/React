# Assignment React Week 2

## **Todo list**

1. Prep exercises
2. Optional: Possible Q&A exercises
3. PROJECT: Ecommerce Shop II
4. Optional: Practice projects
5. Optional: Challenges

## **1. Prep exercises**

> Prep exercises are exercises that you should work on _before_ the session on Sunday. These are a little more difficult or show an important concept and as such are a great exercise to talk about with your mentor. Have a solution ready by Sunday as you may be asked to show what you did.

Inside your `React` fork, go to the folder `week2`. Inside of that folder, navigate to `/prep-exercises`. For each exercise, you will find a separate folder. The `README` explains what needs to be done. There will also be some questions at the bottom to think about. Go through them _before_ the session on Sunday as it will be covered then.

## **2. Optional: Possible Q&A exercises**

> Possible Q&A exercises are exercises that you can nominate to discuss with the Q&A mentor during the session on Sunday. Have a go at these and see which one you find difficult, then you can reply to the thread in your cohort channel with a link to the exercise you want to do.
> Even if the exercise does not get handled in the Q&A session these exercises are good ways to get ideas of what to build to keep practicing.

> If you want to nominate a different exercise you found online then feel free to do so! We may even add that one to the list for the next class to use and attribute it to you ;).

Inside of your `React` fork, go to the folder `week2`. Inside of that folder, navigate to `/possible-qa-exercises`. For each exercise, you will find a separate folder. The `README` explains what needs to be done. Go through them to practice concepts that you have learned about!

## **3. PROJECT: Ecommerce Shop II**

Let's continue building on our application! This week you'll replace the application's data source: instead of using a JSON file you'll be using an external API, called [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

Have a look at the [project/README.md](./project/README.md) file to know what to do this week.

## **4. Optional: Practice projects**

The following exercises give you a prompt of what to build and then provide a solution when stuck. Try to do it yourself as much as possible and then compare to what they give as a solution:

- First let's create a project without an API and [implement a tic-tac-toe game](https://epic-react-exercises.vercel.app/react/hooks/1)
- Now let's use the pokemon API and [build a pokemon finder](https://epic-react-exercises.vercel.app/react/hooks/3)

> The solutions they give is not necessarily the only solution, compare it to yours and see if you can get some good ideas from theirs. Because they want to show just one file, you will notice they put a lot of different functionality in one component. It is generally better to do it in separate components so good job if you thought of that!

## **5. Optional: Challenges**

Remember that our friends over at CodeYourFuture have provided a repository with different ideas for [challenges to build](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-react-challenges). Have a look at the `README.md` in each folder to see what the challenge is and now you can also do ones that require you to connect to an API!

## **SUBMIT YOUR ASSIGNMENT!**

After you've finished your list it's time to show us what you got! Upload all your files to a forked repository (a copy from the original, which in this case is the [React](https://www.github.com/HackYourFuture/React) repository) using GIT. Then make a pull request to your teacher's forked repository.

If you need a refresher, take a look at the following [guide](../hand-in-assignment-guide.md) to see how it's done.

The assignment that needs to be submitted is the following:
