# Beyond React

The following libraries are worth mentioning to use in conjunction with React:

- **[FlowType](https://flowtype.org)** - a way to annotate ES6 with types, similar to TypeScript
- **[Redux](https://flowtype.org)** - predictable (application) state container, a Flux implementation
- **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org)** - a JS packager, used by `create-react-app`
- **[Babel](https://babeljs.io)** - a ES6+ to JS transpiler, also used by `create-react-app`
- **[JSS](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss)** - a way to write CSS-like styles inside your component files
