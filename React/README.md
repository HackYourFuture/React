## Read up before we get started

Watch this video from Facebook about why they started React:

https://youtu.be/nYkdrAPrdcw

Also be sure you're familiar with ES6-syntax. See this video about ES6 (the video is in Node, but the syntax for React is the same):

https://www.lynda.com/Node-js-tutorials/Switching-ES6-Node-js/546100-2.html

This is a handy reference of all features of ES6:

http://es6-features.org

Please *do not worry about understanding all*. However, do make sure you understand the following, as we'll be using them a lot:

- http://es6-features.org/#Constants
- http://es6-features.org/#ObjectMatchingShorthandNotation
- http://es6-features.org/#RestParameter
- http://es6-features.org/#SpreadOperator
