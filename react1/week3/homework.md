# Homework

## Get git ready to work on homework

Using the `hyf-homework` repo. In the terminal run `git status`

If there are changes that have not been committed, figure out what to do with those changes

- Should they be committed to another branch?
- Should they be committed to `main`?
- Should they be discarded?

When you have figured out what to do with the changes and fixed those. Write `git status` again. If it says `nothing to commit, working tree clean`. Then you are ready to create the branch for this weeks homework.

### Creating the branch

Using the `hyf-homework` repo write this command

`git checkout main` - You are now on the `main` branch

`git checkout -b react-react1-week3`

This will create and checkout the branch so you are ready make commits to it

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYlgh9hSWtw) can help. On slack use the #git-support channel to ask questions about git

## Outline

Now instead of using an array to load the default items, use the api found here: `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benna100/391eee7a119b50bd2c5960ab51622532/raw` using `fetch`

Extend your todo list app with the ability to add new todo items with user inputted data and remove existing ones and a deadline for the todo item.

Create an add button, a text input and a deadline input. When the add button is clicked a new todo item is created with the given
description and deadline. Create also a remove button, which when clicked it should remove the todo item from the list.

> Challenge: figure out a way for users to enter the deadline date. This is a great opportunity to think like a community in a wider development community. Perhaps there are some React libraries out there that provide some kind of **date picker**? Also, look at [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/index.html) to see if it could be useful.

Create a component that wraps another component in a black border using [react children](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/how-to-use-props-children-in-react-7d6ab5836c9d)

Demo of how the homework should look

![todolist](assets/todolist.gif)

Here are the requirements for this weeks homework:

- Add a deadline to the todo item
- Create new item using description and deadline that the user inputs
- Possibility to update a todoitem
- Create proptypes for at least one of the components
- Create a border component that wraps a component in a black border

Worth considering:

- What if the description input is empty?
- What if the deadline input is empty?
- What if the deadline is before the current day?
- What if you edit an item with an empty description?

## Extra assignment

Make the exercises in [chat-app](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/React/tree/main/examples/chat-app)!

## Hand in Homework:

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYlgh9hSWtw) for a more detailed go-through of how to hand in homework!

- Use the branch called `react-react1-week3`
- Add all your changes to this branch in the `react/react1/week3` folder.
- Go through the [Homework checklist](#homework-checklist)
- Create a pull request using the `react-react1-week3` branch and give your PR the same name `react-react1-week3`.
- Wait for mentor feedback
- Implement feedback, `add`, `commit` and `push` the changes
- Now you can merge the changes into `main`
- When merged you can **share the github link** to your classes slack channel if you are **proud of what you did** ðŸ’ª
- Now celebrate ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Homework checklist

Go over your homework one last time:

- [ ] Does every file run without errors and with the correct results?
- [ ] Have you used `const` and `let` and avoided `var`?
- [ ] Do the variable, function and argument names you created follow the [Naming Conventions](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md)?
- [ ] Is your code well-formatted (see [Code Formatting](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md))?

## Feedback giving time!

Find a student to give feedback using this site: https://hyf-peer-review.herokuapp.com/. The feedback should be given after the homework has been handed in, preferably two days after.

Give the review on the PR exactly how the mentors do it! To find the link for the PR ask the person you are reviewing :) You can see how to give feedback on a PR using github [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request)

To help you get started with reviewing we have created [some resources](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/curriculum/tree/main/review) about giving feedback. Find them

Why is it important to give feedback? Because it will make you a [better](https://www.brightspot.com/blog/developer-life-5-reasons-why-the-code-review-process-is-critical-for-developers) [developer](https://www.sitepoint.com/the-importance-of-code-reviews/)
