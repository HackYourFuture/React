# Homework

## Get git ready to work on homework

Using the `hyf-homework` repo. In the terminal run `git status`

If there are changes that have not been committed, figure out what to do with those changes

- Should they be committed to another branch?
- Should they be committed to `main`?
- Should they be discarded?

When you have figured out what to do with the changes and fixed those. Write `git status` again. If it says `nothing to commit, working tree clean`. Then you are ready to create the branch for this weeks homework.

### Creating the branch

Using the `hyf-homework` repo write this command

`git checkout main` - You are now on the `main` branch

`git checkout -b react-react1-week1`

This will create and checkout the branch so you are ready make commits to it

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYlgh9hSWtw) can help. On slack use the #git-support channel to ask questions about git

## Todo list

Usign `create-react-app` create a new react project.

## basic React & props

Render a basic static todo list with three items:

```
Todo List

* Get out of bed, Wed Sep 13 2017
* Brush teeth, Thu Sep 14 2017
* Eat breakfast, Fri Sep 15 2017
```

For each item render a description and a deadline date. Before you start draw a mockup and identify the components with colours. You have to use more than two components. Think which props the components should take.

## thinking in React

go through this article https://www.codestackr.com/blog/5-steps-to-think-in-react/ for learning how to think the react way (hooks updated).

## Hand in Homework:

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYlgh9hSWtw) for a more detailed go-through of how to hand in homework!

- Use the branch called `react-react1-week1`
- Add all your changes to this branch in the `react/react1/week1` folder.
- Go through the [Homework checklist](#homework-checklist)
- Create a pull request using the `react-week1` branch and give your PR the same name `react-react1-week1`.
- Wait for mentor feedback
- Implement feedback, `add`, `commit` and `push` the changes
- Now you can merge the changes into `main`
- When merged you can **share the github link** to your classes slack channel if you are **proud of what you did** ðŸ’ª
- Now celebrate ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Homework checklist

Go over your homework one last time:

- [ ] Does every file run without errors and with the correct results?
- [ ] Have you used `const` and `let` and avoided `var`?
- [ ] Do the variable, function and argument names you created follow the [Naming Conventions](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md)?
- [ ] Is your code well-formatted (see [Code Formatting](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md))?

## Feedback giving time!

Find a student to give feedback using this site: https://hyf-peer-review.herokuapp.com/. The feedback should be given after the homework has been handed in, preferably two days after.

Give the review on the PR exactly how the mentors do it! To find the link for the PR ask the person you are reviewing :) You can see how to give feedback on a PR using github [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request)

To help you get started with reviewing we have created [some resources](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/curriculum/tree/main/review) about giving feedback. Find them

Why is it important to give feedback? Because it will make you a [better](https://www.brightspot.com/blog/developer-life-5-reasons-why-the-code-review-process-is-critical-for-developers) [developer](https://www.sitepoint.com/the-importance-of-code-reviews/)
